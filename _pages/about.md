<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a second-year undergraduate student at the School of Artificial Intelligence, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS). My primary research interest lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially in areas such as language model interpretability, reasoning capabilities of large models. I am enthusiastic about research and always eager to collaborate on challenging problems that advance the understanding of intelligent systems.
